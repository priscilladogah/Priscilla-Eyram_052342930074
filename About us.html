    <h1>HISTORY</h1>
     <p><strong>The INTERNATIONAL CENTRAL GOSPEL CHURCH(I.C.G.C) </strong> is an <i>Evangelical Charismatic Christian Church.</i>It was officially inaugrated as a church on the <strong> 26th of February 1984, in Accra,Ghana</strong> with an intial membership of just about twenty people.From<i> February 1984 to April 1986</i> the membership grew to about one hundred and eight(108) adults in a regular attendance.The early meetings of the church were held in several facilities,including classrooms,a private residence,a public hall, a science laboratory, a medical workshop and a cinema theatre. In May 1986, the church settled in a rented scout hall -the Baden Powell Memorial hall -which became its home for the next 10 years.During this ten years period,the membership rose to 4000. This period also saw aggressive missionary church planting activities with local assemblies established in almost all the major town and cities of ghana. Several other churches were also planted in cities in Europe and United states</p>
